Download the test dataset from the University of Toronto: [Boston Real Estate Averages Per Neighborhood, 1990](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html)
#### 1. In-Class: Create Descriptive Statistics for Boston Real Estate Dataset
1. Delete all columns except *CRIM*, *RM*, *AGE*, *PTRATIO*, and *MEDV*.
2. Find the descriptive statistics for all attributes.
3. How do the Median and Mean differ for the Crime Rate? What does that tell you?
4. Run a correlation analysis on the dataset. What two attributes influence each other the most? What attributes influence each other the least?
#### 2. Take-Home: Find a Dataset in Kaggle and Write Report
I want you to find a dataset for something you're interested in and build a short report. I've included a sample [here]() that you can use *(send this to students over Slack)*. 
1. Go to [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) and create an account
2. Find a dataset for something you're interested in
3. Download the dataset as a .CSV and open it in Excel
4. Delete columns until you have the five most relevant (use your discretion here)
5. Run Descriptive Statistics on all attributes. Include 2-3 attributes in your report and briefly talk about them. What stood out to you the most? Did something surprise you?
6. Run Correlations for the entire dataset. Label the columns.
7. For columns with a strong correlation, why do you think that is? Explain your reasoning. 
8. Display a scatter plot for the two strongest-correlating attributes

#### Practical Demonstration
Since we don't know Python yet, we'll be using Jamovi for now.
1. Download [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) (or use the webapp)
2. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIJDJ49WEgw) (22m)
3. And [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNvenQx5djM) (7m)
4. Play around with [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features) and run a linear regression. Find the variables that have the greatest effect on Median House Value.
5. Play around with [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn) and run a logistic regression on the "Exited" column, also known as Churn. Find what variables influence the churn rate the most.
#### Further Reading 
**Do this last**. I want you to have hands-on work first. I encourage you to read this as much as you can, but this isn't 100% required. This is to supplement your knowledge and give you a more in-depth look at Regression.
